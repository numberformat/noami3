# NOAMi3

## Welcome

This is a remix of the Prusa i3 printer.

![](images/20180710_202544.jpg)
This is an earlier version of the printer.

## The goals

* To make the process of building your own printer easy and in-expensive by using lower cost off the shelf components
    - RAMPS compatible main boards
    - MKS Gen 1.4
* Rework some of the design decisions that were made like eliminating the inductive PINDA probe sensor and Bed levelling using multiple independent Z motors.
* Apply latest advancements and make them work with all i3 based printers.
    - Examples include: filament runout sensor, mk3s style extruder

## Cost

All components are easy to source see my [ebay store](https://www.ebay.com/usr/numberf55).
