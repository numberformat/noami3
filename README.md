## Welcome

This is a remix of the Prusa i3 printer.

## The goals

* To make the process of building your own printer easy and in-expensive by using lower cost off the shelf components
    - RAMPS compatible main boards
    - MKS Gen 1.4 or SKR 1.3
* Rework some of the design decisions that were made like eliminating the inductive PINDA probe sensor and Bed levelling using multiple independent Z motors.
* Apply latest advancements and make them work with all i3 based printers.
    - Examples include: filament runout sensor, mk3s style extruder

## Cost

All components are easy to source on ebay and other places.

## Work performed

* 2020-03 - [Dual Z axis bed leveling](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4242081)
* 2020-06 - [New custom MKS Gen 1.4 Case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3012921)
* 2020-07 - [Modified the LCD holders to work with the older Discount Smart Controllers the ones with the variable resistor in the back.](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4521221)
* 2020-07 - [Prusa i3 PSU Cover designed for the IEC320 C14 plug](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4290140)
* 2021-01 - [Setup instructions for the SKR 1.3 with sensorless homing and other advanced features.](skr13.md)
* 2021-12 - Upgraded to the volcano hot end. Conversion made easy by dual z axis bed leveling. I just installed 10mm longer screws
